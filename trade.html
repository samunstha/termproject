          <p> A trademark is a recognizable emblem, phrase, word, or symbol that represents a specific product and legally distinguishes it from all other products of its type. A trademark exclusively recognizes a product as belonging to a specific corporation and identifies the company's title of the brand. 
		  Unlike patents and copyrights, trademarks do not expire after a set term of years. Trademark rights come from actual use. Therefore, a trademark can last forever as long as people continue to use the mark in commerce to indicate the source of goods and services. 
		  A trademark registration can also last forever - so long as people file specific documents and pay fees at regular intervals (USPTO, 2018).
		  At the national level, Trademark protection can be obtained through registration by filing an online application for registration with the national trademark office and paying the required fees. 
		  For more information about Trademark Registration, please visit  <a href = "https://www.uspto.gov/trademark" target ="-blank" > &trade; &reg;  </a> .

		  <p class="dark"> Given the greater significance of the companyâ€™s branding and the tangible economic cost of the brand in the modern economy, Trademark law has become vital than ever before. 
		  As customers become loyal to a certain brand and make buying choices based on their capability to recognize a product of service using a logo or a slogan, these inscriptions aid as a point of differentiation and competitive advantage. 
		  Subsequently, trademark law is central to allow the trademark owner to develop benevolence for the product or service and prevent other parties from manipulating their brand. </p>
