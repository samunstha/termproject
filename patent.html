			<h1 class="page-title"> What is Patent? </h1>
			<p> 
			A patent is a form of intellectual property that provides its owner the legal right to eliminate others from making, using, selling and importing an invention for a limited period of years (usually 20 years), in exchange for publishing an enabling public disclosure of the invention. 
			It offers exclusive rights for an invention, product, or process that provides a new way of doing things. 
			Sometimes it offers a new technical solution to a problem. To get a patent, technical information about the invention must be disclosed to the public in a patent application (USPTO, 2018).		  
			</p>
		 
			<p class="dark"> There are three types of Patents: </p>
			<ol>
			<li> <b>Utility patent: </b> It is a patent which cover anyone who invents a new and useful process, machine, article of manufacture or a composition of matter. </li>
			<br><li> <b>Design patent: </b> It includes an original and ornamental design for a manufactured product. </li>
			<br><li> <b>Plant patent: </b> It is a patent related to a kind of plant which is capable of reproduction. </li>
			</ol>
		
			<p class="dark"> The Patent Application has four main parts: </p>
			<ol>
			<li> <b>Specification: </b> it is the detailed description of an invention. </li>
			<br><li> <b>Abstract: </b> It is the concise summary of an invention. </li>
			<br><li> <b>Drawings: </b> These are images which show how the invention works.</li>
			<br><li> <b>Claims: </b> It is the part of the application which defines the scope of the invention. </li>
			</ol>
			
			<p class="dark"> For an invention to be Patentable, it must satisfy three key criteria: </p>
			<ol>
			<li> 	 <b>New:	</b>   The invention should not be publicly known in any way, anywhere in the world. </li>
			<br><li> <b>Industrial Application: </b> The invention must be useful and have some form of practical application. It should be capable of being made and used in an industry. </li>
			<br><li> <b>Inventive step:  </b> The invention must be an improvement over any existing product or process that is already available.</li>
			</ol>

			<p> “The right deliberated by the patent grant in the language of the law is the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention in the United States or importing the invention into the United States.
			What is granted is not the right to make, use, offer for sale, sell or import, but the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, selling, or importing the invention. 
			Once a patent is issued, the patentee must enforce the patent without aid of the USPTO, and it is valid for 20 years from the date of filing, subject to the payment of annual renewal fees” (USPTO, 2018).
